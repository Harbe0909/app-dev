In "Terminator," a relentless cyborg assassin, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, is sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of the future savior of humanity. A soldier from the future, Kyle Reese, is also sent back to protect her. The film blends action, sci-fi, and suspense, becoming a classic of the genre.
